# Low Level C Programming Exercises
Exercises for learning the C programming language at [Holberton School](https://holbertonschool.com). These exercises are designed to take the student from a complete novice to writing fully functional programs.
## Compilation
All C programs are complied with gcc. All errors must compile with the flags below, using the format below.
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic main.##.c ##-name.c
```
All bash scripts require execution permissions:
```
chmod u+x file
```
## Contributing
These exercises are not open to contribution. They are for reference only.
