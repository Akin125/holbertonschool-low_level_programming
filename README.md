# Low Level C Programming Exercises
Exercises to learn the C programming language at [Holberton School](https://holbertonschool.com). These exercises are designed to take the student from a complete novice to writing fully functional programs.
## Compilation
All C programs are complied with gcc. All errors must compile with the flags below, using the format below.
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic main.##.c ##-name.c
```
All bash scripts require execution permissions:
```
chmod u+x file
```
## Directory Structure
Each directory is named according to the key concept shared by all exercises in the directory. They are numbered sequentially to provide a linear timeline, and build on the key concepts from all previous concepts. Project 0x10-printf is missing from the directory structure, because it is in a separate repository, with another contributor.
## Feedback
I welcome any feedback on the code, as they aid in the ability to understand core concepts for low level programming in C. However, because they are primarily for my personal education, this repository is not open to contribution.
