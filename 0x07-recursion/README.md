# Holberton-School_0x07-Recursion # 

0-puts_recursion.c 
	Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

1-print_rev_recursion.c
	Write a function that prints a string, in reverse.

2-strlen_recursion.c
	Write a function that returns the length of a string.

3-factorial.c
	Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

4-pow_recursion.c
Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);
If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1
FYI: The standard library provides a different function: pow. Run man pow to learn more.

5-sqrt_recursion.c
Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);
If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1
FYI: The standard library provides a different function: sqrt. Run man sqrt to learn more.

6-is_prime_nuber.c
Write a function that returns 1 if a number is a prime number, 0 otherwise.

7-is_palindrome.c
Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

100-wildcmp.c
Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered as identical, and 0 otherwise.

Prototype: int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
s2 can contain the special character *.
The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string)
